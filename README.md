# MATLAB Code for Core-shell-spherical-DEP-polarization-model
Overview
This MATLAB code repository presents an implementation of the core-shell spherical dielectrophoresis (DEP) polarization model for analyzing the electrical properties of biological cells. The oprimary focus is highlighting the role of the linear scalar (equivalent to the Clausius-Mossotti factor). The code utilizes the fminsearchbnd function in MATLAB for nonlinear fitting, adjusting parameters (ε_mem, σ_cyto, ε_cyto, and the linear scalar) to maximize the R-value and enhance the agreement between the model and experimental data.

Below are instructions for running the Fit_DEP_Spectrum_Multi_for_model:
